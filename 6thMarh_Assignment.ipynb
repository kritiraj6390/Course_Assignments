It is a way of quantitatively summarizing and describing information about a population or a sample of interest.

It helps to describe the basic features of the data in a concise and meaningful way. Examples of descriptive statistics include measures of central tendency like mean, median and mode, measures of variability like range, variance and standard deviation, and graphical methods like histograms and box plots. Descriptive statistics might be used in fields such as market research, public health, and social sciences to describe data characteristics.\n",

It involves the application of probability theory and statistical inference techniques to make generalizations about a population based on a sample. Examples of inferential statistics include hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis. Inferential statistics might be used in fields such as medical research, polling, and quality control."
