    "# Outliers are values that lie far outside the range of the rest of the data in a dataset. Outliers can have a significant effect on measures of central tendency and dispersion, as they can pull these measures in one direction or another.\n",

    "# For measures of central tendency, outliers can significantly affect the mean, but have less of an impact on the median and mode. This is because the mean is sensitive to extreme values, whereas the median and mode are not .\n",

    "# The mean salary is 45000, while the median salary is 42500, and the mode is not applicable. Now, if we add an outlier salary of 500000 to the dataset, the mean salary increases significantly to 110000, while the median remains the same. This shows how outliers can significantly affect the mean, but have little effect on the median. Similarly, the range, variance, and standard deviation would increase significantly, indicating a skewed distribution."
